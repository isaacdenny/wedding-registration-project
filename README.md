# Wedding Registration Project
A simple application for registering attendees for our wedding!

## Project Summary

This project is built to be a tool for registering our party members, letting
us know who is coming to the wedding! Invitees register online with 
their party name and invitation ID, then select who in their party is coming.

We did not want to pay a bunch of money for a simple registration app, so I built one!
